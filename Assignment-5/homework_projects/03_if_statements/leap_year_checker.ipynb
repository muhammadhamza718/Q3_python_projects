    "### What is a Leap Year?\n",
    "A **leap year** (also known as an intercalary or bissextile year) is a year that contains an **extra day** to keep the calendar aligned with the Earth's orbit. In the **Gregorian calendar**, a leap year has **366 days** instead of **365**, with February having **29 days** instead of **28**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Leap Year Rules:\n",
    "A year is a leap year if:\n",
    "1. It is **divisible by 4**.\n",
    "2. However, if the year is **divisible by 100**, it is **not** a leap year, unless:\n",
    "3. The year is also **divisible by 400**, in which case it **is** a leap year.\n",
    "\n",
    "The program should determine leap years based on these rules and print:\n",

    "- `\"That's not a leap year.\"` if it's not.\n",
