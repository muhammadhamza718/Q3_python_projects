    "## Affirmation Checker Program\n",
    "\n",
    "### Explanation:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The goal of this program is to repeatedly prompt the user to type a ***specific affirmation*** until they type it correctly.\n",
    "- The affirmation used is:\n",
    "\"I am capable of doing anything I put my mind to.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "- **How the program works:**\n",
    "1. It displays the affirmation and asks the user to type it.\n",
    "2. If the user input **does not match**, the program informs them and prompts them again.\n",
    "3. This loop continues until the user types the correct affirmation.\n",
    "4. Once the correct affirmation is entered, a success message is displayed.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Key concepts used:**\n",
    "- **String comparison** to check if the input matches the affirmation.\n",
    "- **While loop** to keep prompting the user until they type it correctly.\n",
    "- **User input handling** using `input()`.\n",
    "\n",
    "This program serves as a small motivational tool while reinforcing **string handling and loops*"
