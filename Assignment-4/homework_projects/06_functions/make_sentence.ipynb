    "## Generating Sentences Based on Word Type\n",
    "\n",
    "### Problem Description:\n",
    "- The program takes a **word** as input.\n",
    "- It asks the user to classify the word as a **noun, verb, or adjective** using numbers:\n",
    "  - **0 for noun**\n",
    "  - **1 for verb**\n",
    "  - **2 for adjective**\n",
    "- It then prints a sentence using that word in a predefined **sentence template**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example:\n",
    "#### **Input:**\n",
    "Please type a noun, verb, or adjective: groovy Is this a noun, verb, or adjective? Type 0 for noun, 1 for verb, 2 for adjective: 2\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Output:**\n",
    "Looking out my window, the sky is big and groovy!\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Sentence Templates**\n",
    "| Part of Speech | Sentence Template |\n",
    "|---------------|----------------|\n",
    "| 0 (Noun) | \"I am excited to add this ____ to my vast collection of them!\" |\n",
    "| 1 (Verb) | \"It's so nice outside today it makes me want to ____!\" |\n",
    "| 2 (Adjective) | \"Looking out my window, the sky is big and ____!\" |\n",
    "\n",
    "### Approach:\n",
    "1. **User Input**:\n",
    "   - Get a word from the user.\n",
    "   - Get the part of speech as an integer (`0, 1, or 2`).\n",
    "2. **Use Conditional Statements (`if-elif-else`)**:\n",
    "   - Print a sentence using the correct template.\n",
    "3. **Handle Invalid Input**:\n",
    "   - If the user enters a number other than `0, 1, or 2`, display an error message.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Key Concepts Used:**\n",
    "- **Conditional Statements (`if-elif-else`)**\n",
    "- **String Formatting**\n",
    "- **User Input Handling (`input()`)**"
